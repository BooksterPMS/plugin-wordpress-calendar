Add Bookster Availibility Calendar Widgets for your Bookster properties to your posts and pages

== Description ==

If you are a [Bookster](https://www.booksterhq.com/) user with an active Subscription and at least one property, you can use this plugin to add a calendar widget linked to your Bookster property.

You can have as many calendar widgets as you have properties. The plugin will create a shortcode that then you can add to any of your posts and pages.

The calendar allows your site visitors to set a check-in and check-out and then perform a search of the availibility directly on the Bookster search page for the related property.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `bookster-acw` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** screen (**Plugins > Installed Plugins**).

You will find **Bookster ACW** menu in your WordPress admin screen.
